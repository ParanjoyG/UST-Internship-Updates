speech = "10:30pm â€“ Night Before the Election What a scene.\nWhat a crowd.\nThank you for Virginia.\n(Crowd chants \"yes we can.\") Let me start by noting, Virginia that this is our last rally.\nThis is the last rally of a campaign that began nearly 2 years ago.\nWe've gone to every corner of this country, from here in Northern Virginia to the rocky coasts of Maine, to the open plains of Texas, to the open skies of Montana.\nI just want to say that whatever happens tomorrow, I have been deeply humbled by this journey.\nYou have welcomed Michelle and me and the girls into your homes.\nYou have shared your stories of struggle, you have spoken of your dreams, along the way, talking with all of you about your own lives.\nYou have enriched my life, you have moved me again and again.\nYou have inspired me.\nSometimes when I have been down you have lifted me up.\nYou filled me with new hope for our future and you have reminded me about what makes America so special.\nIn the places I have gone and the people I have me, you've heard stories of love, closeness and love.\nIn the places you have faced the very trauma of becoming completely separated.\nYou have realized how much you need to love yourself.\nMy life has reached such a high point.\nYou have changed everything about you.\nI was so lucky to be with you as a young boy from the first step.\nI have had to have peace.\nI had to accept the decision of to do what I wanted to do.\nI have to have peace.\nThat is a message that I am going to bring.\nIt is not that I fee myself any money, nor will I see myself in your way.\nBut I hope I did.\nI wish I had never seen this girl with that relaxed body and feeling that my young days are over.\nIt is a time when it is time for me to start living that way and to move on.\nI've always been pretty outgoing.\nEvery single time I had a kiss, I felt safe."
